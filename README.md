# Mood Display Demo Project

## Getting Started

#### Server:
To start the server in the server directory, initially run `npm install` once completed run `npm start` to start the node server running. 

#### UI:
To build the frontend, within the mood_display directory, initially run `npm install` there after you can run `npm run dev` to build and start the dev enviroment.
With the server running open your browser to 'localhost:3000'.

## Why

I was tasked to build a small coding demonstration, I was provided with the design, JSON data and business rules for determining when to display one of the three states.
